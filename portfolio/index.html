          <h4>Prosper AI Product Page</h4>
          <img src="../assets/portfolio/Prosper Product.gif"/>
          <p>TDuring my internship at Prosper AI, my primary focus was developing their upcoming mobile app. As a concluding task, I designed a product page for their public website, utilizing Next.JS, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS for the development.</p>

          <h4>The 1975 Mock Website</h4>
          <img src="../assets/portfolio/the 1975.gif"/>
          <p>I developed this static site using server-side rendering with EJS (Embedded JavaScript). Given that The 1975 is one of my favorite bands, I took inspiration from their website. It sparked an idea: "Why not recreate their site, adding my personal touch and flair to it?"</p>

          <p>This is a simple weather app to display weather data based on a search location. It renders HTML elements using DOM manipulation and pulls data from a weather API. Type in a city name and hit the enter button. The app works by either city or state name.</p>
