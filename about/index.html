          <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am currently employed as a Master Data Software Engineer Apprentice for HP. I have been programming for about 3 years, starting by teaching myself and then attending a coding bootcamp. You can view a comprehensive summary of my experiences <a href="../experience/">here</a>. Before making this career pivot, I was a touring and session musician, and while I don't tour anymore, I am still available for session work! I have two dogs who I like to pretend are my real children, whom I love very much!
